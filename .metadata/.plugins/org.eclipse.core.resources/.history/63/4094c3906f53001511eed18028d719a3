 *      Implement a double-linked list that stores strings. Your implementation should support the following operations:
•	Initialize the list
•	Add a string to the end of the list
•	Empty the list
•	Print the elements of the list
•	Sort the elements of the list in lexical order using bubble sort.
Your implementation cannot copy elements as part of the implementation of bubble sort. You must use pointer operations to reorder the elements of a list appropriately.
For this problem, make sure to use the function definitions provided in list.h.
